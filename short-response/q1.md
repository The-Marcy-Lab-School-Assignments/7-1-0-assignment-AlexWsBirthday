# Question

When should Context be used? 

# Answer
context should be used when there are more than two components that must utilize the data from an initialized state in a parent component, to avoid having to pass the state down from component to component.

The key point about avoiding prop drilling is there, but try to emphasize efficiency in larger component trees and use the term itself.

You could provide an example or mention the kinds of data (e.g., user info, theme settings) typically shared via context.
