# Question

Imagine that somewhere, you have already created a context object called `SomeContext`. 

```js
// context/SomeContext.js
import { createContext } from "react";

const SomeContext = createContext();

export default SomeContext;
```

Modify the code snippet below such that:
1. The `App` component provides the value held by the `data` variable to its descendants using `SomeContext`.
2. The `Child` component is able to extract that `data` value from `SomeContext`.


# Answer

```js
import { useContext, useState } from 'react'
import SomeContext from "./context/SomeContext";


//the child is what is going to be using the context, so we can skip the parent
const Child = () => {
  //import the data from SomeContext using the useContext hook in the scope of the child component
  const data = useContext(SomeContext)
  return <p>{data}</p>
}

const Parent = () => {
  return <Child />
}

const App = () => {
  const data = 'some data to provide via context';

  return (
    //wrap the parent in the context provider component so the child component of said parent can successfully access the SomeContext data 
    <SomeContext.Provider value={data}>
    <Parent />
    </SomeContext.Provider >
  )
}
```
