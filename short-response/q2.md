# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer
1. Create a context object 
    * import create context as a named import from react
    * initialize a default value with an empty object (just in case)
    * initialize a variable that invokes the createContext function, which builds a new object to export
    * export the context variable

2. Render a context provider (since it's a component)
    * import the context into the desired component that you wish to wrap other components in, within the context you created
    * create the context values based off the states you already initialized and wish to use across components (useState first)
    * wrap the components in the context provider component in the returned JSX
    * set the value prop of the context provider to the context values you just set

3. Use the context
    * import the context from the context folder 
    * get the context values by setting a context values variable and using the useContext hook on the context you just imported
    * use the context values

The answer is correct overall, though could have been slightly more detailed.
Good structure and explanation, but could be clearer in the final step on using the context.
Consider using more consistent terminology (like "context object" and "provider") to avoid confusion.
