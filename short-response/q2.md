# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer
1. Create a context object 
    * import create context as a named import from react
    * initialize a default value with an empty object (just in case)
    * initialize a variable that invokes the createContext function, which builds a new object to export
    * export the context variable

2. Render a context provider (since it's a component)
    * import the context into the desired component that you wish to wrap other components in, within the context you created
    * create the context values based off the states you already initialized and wish to use across components (useState first)
    * wrap the components in the context provider component in the returned JSX
    * set the value prop of the context provider to the context values you just set

3. Use the context
    * import the context from the context folder 
    * get the context values by setting a context values variable and using the useContext hook on the context you just imported
    * use the context values
